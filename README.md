This is the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) version of the 2nd edition of British Ecological Society's "Guide to Reproducible Code". A print version of this guide has also been [published as a PDF file on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16421732). 

Assuming you already know the basics of programming (such as in the languages R or Python), this guide will show you how to publish the code you write so that it is reprodicible and FAIR for others (and your future self!).
